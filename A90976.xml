         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>I Had no deſire to appear ſo publickely; neither had I ſo appeared now, if the wrong and abuſe had reflected onely upon my ſelf: but leſt that the truth (profeſſed by me) ſhould be abuſed through my being ſilent, ſeeing that the good will of our God was to deprive me, and many more, of my Brother <hi>Hugh Evans,</hi> who was buried before the appearance of <hi>John Moones</hi> printed Paper: For if he had lived, I ſhould not have ſo publickely appeared in this Work, he being chiefly accuſed and abuſed by the aforeſaid <hi>John Moone.</hi> And ſeeing that I am alſo groſſely abuſed, and my words perverted, I judge it my duty, and know it my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to clear my ſelf and others, from the aſperſions falſly caſt upon us, and vindicate the truth profeſſed by us. I would have the Reader to know, that I have no prejudicial thoughts towards <hi>John Moone;</hi> though I have worſe thoughts of him then I have of many of his Brethren, I would not the leaſt wrong done to his (nor their) Perſons; and I would as willingly give them the liberty of their conſciences, as I would have the liberty of my own. Drunkards and Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers can go without being perſecuted, neither dragged or haled to Priſon, when civil, ſober harmleſſe men, under the name of Hereticks, are abuſed and impriſoned, and be judged by vile carnal unjuſt Judges, who have no Religion nor God, (but their bellies:) but if any ſhould ſay now, he taketh the part of thoſe whom he himſelf oppoſeth: (It is true) I do ſo, but I do not oppoſe them (peradventure) as thou doſt. It may be thou wouldeſt have men to be of thy Religion, be it right or wrong, whether they can believe it or not or elſe thou wilt have them perſecuted and impriſoned, and ſo force them to make Shipwracke of their conſcience, or to ſuffer
<pb facs="tcp:151290:6"/>perſecution: And I would uſe all Lawful meanes, in love, meekneſſe, and tenderneſſe, to convince them of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and if I could be a meanes to win them, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord with them; if not, I will pity them, and mourn for them; and not ſeek to deſtroy them, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of moſt of all Nations is, not conſidering that the ninth hour may be behind, or that they may be called at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour: But thou wouldeſt have them to obſerve thy time, and not ſuffer them to ſtay for God's time; or if they will not obſerve thy time, thou wouldeſt have them deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not ſuffer them to live until the laſt hour, to ſee if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure they may enter into the Vineyard and will of God, and be ſaved.</p>
                        <p>But I ſhall deſire thee, and all men, to learn of the Spirit of grace and meekneſſe, rather to pity then to perſecute thy poor miſerable Brother, who was created and eſtated with thee in Paradiſe, who alſo have fallen from thence with thee, and became Children of wrath: and though by grace thou art recovered to a lively hope of that glory that ſhall be revealed; O (I ſay) rather learn to pity, and to long for the recovery of him out of the ſnares of the Devil, then to hate and perſecute him. So I leave thee, and deſire to find thee led by the Spirit of moderation and wiſedom; and remain a Lover and well-wiſher of thy ſoul and body:</p>

                  <p>TO all them in whom a ſparkle of true grace, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere zeal hath once been kindled, and have felt the weight, and ſeen the odiouſneſſe and filth of their ſins; And by the light and love of the Father being kindled in the heart, have ſeen, and judged it but just to deliver up unto death that Murtherer, who hath killed the just; and ſo have put on a Righteous Reſolution, and continueth in the Battle, and fighteth under the Banner of God's love: and though peradventure you have been benighted in the purſuit of your Enemy, and were at a ſtand in a deſolate Wilderneſſe; yet your hatred against the Enemy remaining (that is to ſay, your own ſins, fleſhly wills and deſires) and a longing deſire after that peaceable Habitation and life, which is to be attained unto through death: I wiſh that Chriſt's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation may prevail with you in this confuſed age, in which there is ſo many Loe here, and loe there; Be ye as wiſe as Serpents, and harmleſſe as Doves: wiſedom and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency are excellent vertues at all times, but eſpecially in theſe dayes, wherein there are ſo many Forms and Profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Godlineſſe; and Antichrist most ſubtilly hath laid its ſnare in every one of them; and no ſooner he is found out in one ſhape, but ſpeedily he ſhifts himſelf into another ſhape or Form, and decketh, trimmeth, ſitteth, and ſheweth himſelf as though he is God: So I deſire that you would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve his motions, and refuſe his ſociety; and that you may die dayly to every thing that dieth, and ſo be weaned
<pb facs="tcp:151290:7"/>from the Vanities of this preſent evil World. Chiefly for your ſakes have I publiſhed ſomewhat of that which hath paſſed between the Baptized Believers in theſe Countries, and the people known by the name of <hi>Quakers.</hi> As for the people in general, I ſhall not ſay much of, but chiefly thoſe which I and others in theſe Countries have had experience of their Doctrine, Lives, and Converſations: they have not been in this Countrey but about eighteen Moneths; and to ſpeak the truth, they brought many ſhifts with them: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thirteen Moneths was come about, they were worn thred-bare, in ſo much that their nakedneſſe and ſhame was ſeen. So I commend you with all Saints to the meek love of God. I rest, and remain,</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was a meeting in the Pariſh of <hi>Llauvr,</hi> in <hi>Raduorſhire,</hi> where <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing his Gifts, to the edifying and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of his Brethren in the Faith and fear of the Lord; and in his exerciſe he ſaid to this effect, That there is a threefold nature in the people of God: The Divine Nature, The Humane Nature, And the Serpentine Nature: The ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151290:8"/>under the feet of the ſeed of the Woman; the ſeed of the Serpent bruiſing the heele, but the ſeed of the Woman bruiſing the head: then one <hi>John David</hi> a Quaker, ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from other men, ſpake to this effect, or theſe very words: I deny thy third; there is but two; ſtop thy mouth; the Plagues and Judgements of God is thy portion: and with many preſumptuous words in the name of the Lord, he rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much againſt us; and ſo began to teach the people, and held forth that there is but two things, light and darkneſſe; God, and the Devil; the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent; and many things to that purpoſe. After him <hi>John Moone</hi> began his Leſſon: but <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> made ſome reply to this effect, That if it was ſo as they ſaid, that there is but two things, light, and darkneſſe; God, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent; then what is that which is to be ſaved, or to be damned? for it is impoſſible for the ſeed of the Serpent to be ſaved, nor for the ſeed of the Woman to be Eternally damned.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>John David</hi> did give no ſound anſwer; and I believe that all rational men will ſay, that he could not: Then this queſtion was by us propounded to <hi>John Moone,</hi> but his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was no better then the other: Whereupon the ſaid <hi>John Moone</hi> ſtared in <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> his eyes, and asked him many queſtions (though they themſelves cry out againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for asking of queſtions) ſome of them I can yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The firſt queſtion he asked him, was this: <hi>Art thou come to the beginning?</hi> He anſwered: I am come to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the end, Chriſt Jeſus. Again he asked him: <hi>Hast thou eaten of the Tree of Life?</hi> He ſaid, He had. Then <hi>John Moone</hi> ſaid, <hi>How comest thou there?</hi> Thou knoweſt what the ſword of the <hi>Cherubin</hi> is: <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſaid, It is the anger of God. Then he asked, <hi>What the Soul was?</hi> Upon that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> not to anſwer him, knowing them to be but the Cavillers queſtions. Then <hi>John Moon</hi> ſaid to the people, This man, who is your Teacher, knoweth not what the ſoul is. Then <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſaid, Anſwer not a Fool ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his folly, leſt thou be like him; yet anſwer a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151290:8"/>Fool according to his folly, leſt he be wiſe in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: And ſo <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſtood up, and read this Scripture, <hi>And God breathed into man the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul;</hi> and ſo gave the people a Deſcription of the ſoul of man. And after he had done, ſome that were there deſired <hi>John Moone</hi> to gainſay, if he could, what <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> had ſaid concerning the ſoul, but he did not: much confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed diſcourſe hath been that day, which cannot be repeated; neither is it worth the repeating.</p>
                        <p>At another time there was a meeting of theirs, at a place called <hi>Yſcwriw;</hi> to which meeting <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> and others went; and he accuſed them of denying the Reſurrection, and deſired time and ſilence to prove it, but could not have it, but much bruitiſh and unreaſonable Behaviour: ſhortly after I ſent theſe enſuing queries to <hi>John Moone:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether God and man was not two diſtinct things, after he had created him?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether man onely did not ſall from that peaceable eſtate, which God had created, and ſtared him in, and no part of God fell with him, or in him?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whether that formed creature man, or that body which God created in the beginning, did not become mertal, and must die the natural death?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Whether that body, or the bodies of all men, ſhall not at the last day, or at the diſſolution of this world, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be raiſed up out of the Earth, and receive a just Sentence?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe queries he did take upon him to anſwer: But I will leave it to the Reader, to judge what manner of anſwer it is. Their anſwer, with their queries, are as followeth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>John Price,</hi> I having received thy Paper, wherein thou ſeekeſt to put a Cloak on thy errors, which Paper. I am made free to anſwer for the innocent ſake, and not to ſatisfie thy buſy mind.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Whereas thou broughteſt the Scripture in <hi>Nehene.</hi> 7.5, 64. to be a Cloak for thy error and covetouſneſſe: but the Scripture doth declare againſt all errors and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe; wherein thou art ſhut out of the Scriptures, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151290:9"/>art a ſtranger to the life of God, which gave forth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, living in thy Ignorance and covetouſneſſe, wreſting the Scriptures to thy own deſtruction.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer:</hi> It is not for that word Regiſter that I charged thee withall, for the word in its place I own: But for that thou doſt follow the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſſe, but was rebuked for his Iniquity; and ſo I rebuke thee: and whereas thou haſt confuſedly written in thy Paper, concerning Juſtice of the Peace, and naming no man, yet for truth ſake I anſwer.</p>
                        <p>All that are true Miniſters of God, and Magiſtrates I own; and all that are juſt, and do juſtice, is more acceptable to the Lord then ſacrifice; and all that acts for the puniſhment of the Evil-doers, and the praiſe of them that do well: For ſo is the will of God, that with well-doing we may put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Ignorant and the Fooliſh men: And herein is our Father glorified, and the Enemies of God diſcovered; and all them that acts not according to that which is juſt, I deny. An Anſwer to thy queries.</p>
                        <p>Firſt Query: <hi>Whether God and man was two diſtinct things, after he had created him?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer:</hi> The Lord God is Eternal, and endures for ever, and he formed man of the duſt of the Earth, which is Carnal.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Query: <hi>Whether man onely did not fall from that peaceable eſtate, which God had created, and ſtated him in, and no part of God fell with him, or in him?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer:</hi> It was man onely that brake the Command of God, as by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned: herein I deny, that that which is of God, ſhould fall into ſin, or Iniquity.</p>
                        <p>The third Query: <hi>Whether that formed Creature man, or that body which God Created in the beginning, did not become mortal, and must die the natural death?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer:</hi> All fleſh ſhall periſh, and man ſhall return to the duſt, from whence he was taken.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Query: <hi>Whether that body, or the bodies of all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151290:9"/>men, ſhall not at the last day, or at the diſſolution of this world, and all Creatures, be raiſed up out of the Earth, and receive a just Sentence?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer:</hi> All ſhall be changed: for the Trumpet ſhall ſound; they that have done good, to the Reſurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the Reſurrection of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Here is thy objections and queries anſwered, by him whom the world calls <hi>John Moons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Paper, which he firſt makes mention of, I ſent to him, I have not the Copy of, elſe I would have ſet it down here, but the effect of it was this: <hi>John Moone</hi> hath char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me with <hi>Balaams</hi> ſin, and why? but becauſe I was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter: and he preſſed upon me to prove my practiſe by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and prove a Regiſter in the Church of God: Then I produced in my Letter that Scripture, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.5, 64. which is effectual to anſwer what he demanded: and as he is full of confuſion in other things; ſo alſo in this, in not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing between the Church and Commonwealth: to be an Officer of a juſt Law, and juſtly executed, is no ſin; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any more error nor covetouſneſſe in it, then is in any other calling whatſoever: and wherein he compares me to <hi>Balaam,</hi> who would by Witch-craft deſtroy all the people of God; I will not trouble my ſelf about it, but leave ſuch a plain caſe to the Reader, to judge of the unequality of the compariſon.</p>
                        <p>Here followeth ſeveral queries, ſent by <hi>John Moone,</hi> and one <hi>John David,</hi> to <hi>Hugh Evans,</hi> and <hi>John Price,</hi> which are as followeth.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151290:10"/>queries: We anſwer to your firſt, That it is repentance from dead works, and that is attainable this ſide the grave, or the natural death. Be aſhamed of your ignorance, in asking ſuch a queſtion, as whether pure Religion is attainable in this life.</p>
                        <p>Second query: <hi>What that light is which lighteth every man that comes into the world; and whether that light is within in the conſcience, yea, or nay?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Second Anſwer:</hi> Chriſt is that light, and it ſhineth in ſome men's conſcience, and not in all; for <hi>Eſai.</hi> ſaith, that there be ſome men which have no light in them.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Third Anſwer:</hi> It is ſufficient.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourth Anſwer:</hi> God ſpake to himſelf, as he was Father, Son, and Spirit: and as touching the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> where it is, and ſeeing you would have us to prove by plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, we direct you to the firſt Book of Moſes, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter; not becauſe we have no more to ſay of it, but that <hi>Iſmael</hi> is not worthy of it, or you ſcoffers.</p>

                        <p>READER, Before I ſet down the anſwer to this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going reply (as they call it) which <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> and I have ſent to <hi>John Moone</hi> and <hi>John David;</hi> I ſhall give you a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> was.</p>
                        <p>Seeing that <hi>Iohn Moone</hi> hath the face as to give <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> the Title of a blind Prieſt, therefore Iſhall enforme you of what <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> was; He in his youthful time was bound Apprentiſe in the City of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to a Clothier; and there he learned the Trade, and wrought there many years: Then in the time of the Wars he went from <hi>Worceſter</hi> to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry, Worceſter</hi> being then a Gariſon for the King, and there joyned himſelf to the Church, and wrought there for certain years; and being zealous in the Goſpel, and his love much kindled towards God and man, and hearing that his native Countrey was deſtitute of that means of Salvation (that is to ſay) the Preaching of the word, and the Miniſtration of the Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, he was much moved with love to the truth, and to his native Countrey: yet not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf fully furniſhed or fitted for that work and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, he by the conſent of the Church went to a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151290:12"/>of the Lord, <hi>Ieremiah Ives,</hi> and informed him, and the ſociety there with him, of the neceſſity of the Preaching of the Word in <hi>Wales;</hi> then were they ſent, and came to <hi>Wales,</hi> and performed the work which they were ſent to do. <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> having no other mind but to return, then the Brethren beſought him to abide with them, the which he accordingly did for the ſpace often years, and upwards, until the Lord ſaw good to deprive them of him; in which time his Friends can give a large Teſtimony of his Zeal, and labour in the Goſpel; yet this lying man <hi>Iohn Moone</hi> hath the face as to ſay that he was a blind Prieſt in <hi>Wales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here followeth another Paper of <hi>Iohn Moone,</hi> which is like the reſt, and my reply to it: but you ſhall find more by a Friend of mine, who hath been accuſed for the ſame things by the forenamed <hi>Iohn Moone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I went from <hi>David VVilliam</hi> unto <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> and <hi>John Price,</hi> to give the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> a Paper: The ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> fell a diſcourſing with me, in which diſcourſe the ſaid <hi>Iohn Price</hi> ſaid that the Devil was Eternal: And he asked me whether I would deny it? And I ſaid, I deny that the Devil is Eternal, and bade him prove it by Scripture: but he did not; neither would he acknowledge that he told a lie, but goeth on in ſin, beguiling unſtable people; and herein thou <hi>Iohn Price</hi> art found one of them who ſaid that God was their Father, but they were of their Father the Devil; and thou calleſt the Devil Eternal; and herein I ſee thee forſaking the right way, &amp; art gone aſtray, following the luſt of the fleſh, living out of the fear of God, ſpeaking high ſwelling words of vanity, but is found out among the Dogs, and Sorcerers, and unbelievers, and they who loves to make a lie, and before the everlaſting fire of the Lord is kindled for the Devil and his Angels. And herein I <hi>Iohn Moone</hi> do bear witneſſe, that the Lord God of Heaven and Earth is Eternal, and what ever is Eternal, is one with the Lord God, and endures for ever: And herein I utterly deny that the Devil is one with God, whom thou ſayeſt is Eternal; and ſo let that of God in all conſciences judge, whether God and the Devil be both one; for he that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151290:12"/>is Eternal is one with God; and this is he who is our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for evermore: but he, who calls the Devil Eternal, knows not Salvation, for there is no Salvation to be found in him, but woe and miſery; which is the portion of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and herein we bear witneſſe to the truth, and againſt that which is untruth.</p>

                        <p>Here followeth my anſwer to <hi>John Moones</hi> fore-going Paper.</p>
                        <p>A word to thee <hi>Iohn Moone,</hi> in anſwer to thy ſcandalous Paper, which I have received from thee upon the 21th day of the firſt moneth, in the year 1656. in which I find more of thy vainjangling and falſe accuſing, as thy manner is, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make me and all Saints odious: But bleſſed are ye when men revile you, and ſpeak all manner of evil of you wrongfully, as thou and thy fellowes do unto me, and others who walk in the fear of the Lord, and do continue by his goodneſſe in his grace, to which he hath called and choſen us, and eſtabliſhed our ſouls and ſpirits therein; yet you (that is to ſay) <hi>Iohn Moone,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Davies,</hi> do call us Dogs, the ſeed of the Serpent, and Sons of the Devil, and Children of darkneſſe; and preſumptuouſly in the name of the Lord excommunicate us (if your curſing could) from the love and grace of our God, in pronouncing all the wrath and plagues of the Eternal God, to fall upon us, and ſaying to your own hurt, that you are ſent of God ſo to do. I ſhall not bring againſt thee any railing accuſations, but the Lord rebuke thee: and touching what hath been ſaid by me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the immortality of the Devil, It was to this effect: <hi>Iohn Moone</hi> ſaid, that whoſoever is not Eternal, is external, and that God onely is Eternal: I ſaid that the Devil is not external, and therefore Eternal, as it did follow from thy own words: And I did then explain my meaning thus; I do not ſay he is a Devil from Eternity, but through or by his forſaking his firſt eſtate and habitation, he became a Devil;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151290:13"/>and I asked thee, whether thou wouldeſt deny, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is Eternal without end; for it did follow from thy words before, that he hath an end, in ſaying, that whatſoever is not Eternal, is external, and that God onely is Eternal: for that which is external will have an end; ſo that one of thoſe two things will unavoidably follow, that either the Devil is mortal, and will have an end, as all external things will have an end; or elſe he is one with God; which I deny, that the Devil is one with God. See now the ſnare which thou haſt laid for me, thy ſelf art fallen therein; and whereas thou ſayeſt, that I would neither prove by Scripture the Devil to be Eternal, nor acknowledge, that I had told a lie: I refuſed to prove him to be a Devil from Eternity, as thou wouldeſt have me; the which I neither did ſpeak nor mean: but I offered to prove him to be endleſſe; I mean by the word Eternal, a thing which endureth for ever, as Angels and ſouls of men, and not alwayes that Eternal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, unchangeable, the onely wiſe God, who comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things, and nothing can comprehend him: and to ſay, that any thing elſe is ſo, is blaſphemy: nothing is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but God, nothing onely wiſe but the Eternal God; but Angels and the ſouls of men do change their eſtates and conditions, yet that doth not diſſolve them: Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Devils, and men became ſinners: The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die; and he hath made his ſoul a Sacrifice for ſin: there is a natural death, and there is a Spiritual death; a dying life, and a living death: and as thou ſayeſt, that the Devil ſhall be caſt into the wrath of God, that is true; but that doth not prove him to be external, or to have an end; that doth prove a change of condition, and not a diſſolution, or to have an end. Doſt thou know from whence, or what is the root from whence the Angels and ſouls of men came? Thou ſayeſt that thou art come to the beginning: if it had been true, thou ſhould deſt have ſeen the end alſo, and that between.</p>
                        <p>And concerning that which thou calleſt a reply unto an anſwer of <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> and my ſelf, in which thou ſayeſt that the firſt principle of pure Religion was before tranſgreſſion;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151290:13"/>Was not this thy query? What is the firſt principle of pure Religion? And I ſay, that before tranſgreſſion there was no need of Faith nor Religion: but if it had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, What is the firſt pure principle? we ſhould have returned you another anſwer; but as the caſe ſtands now with man, being a ſinner, we ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. that it is <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas you ſay that we deny the Teſtimony of <hi>Iohn,</hi> you do ſay amiſſe: but we ſay with the Prophet <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. That if men ſpeak not according to the word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in them.</p>

                        <p>Now I am come briefly to anſwer to that which <hi>Iohn Moone</hi> chargeth <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> and I with, in his Book, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The true light hath made manifest darkneſſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iohn Moone</hi> begins his Book with a glorious Title, <hi>The true light hath made manifeſt darkneſſe:</hi> But before he went any further, his Pen went righter then his confuſed mind; for ſaid he, or <hi>Sion</hi> builded up, before he ſaid that <hi>Babylon</hi> was thrown down: And true it is, that ſuch a <hi>Sion</hi> may be is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up amongſt them, wherein a <hi>Babylon</hi> is yet in them to be thrown down; for if ever there hath been confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt any people, it is amongſt them: but know this, that as <hi>Babylon</hi> is thrown down, ſo is <hi>Sion</hi> builded up; and not <hi>Sion</hi> firſt builded up, and then <hi>Babylon</hi> thrown down. He goeth on, and ſaith, With a true anſwer to what the Baptiſts Teachers objected againſt him, (as he calls them) but it is no anſwer to any one particular, that they objected againſt, (that I know of) but to his own forged or conceited lies, ſo goeth on, and towards the latter end of Page the firſt, he falls to Prayer; and well he may record it (for I think) it is a work he doth but ſeldome.</p>
                        <p>In his 2d Page he begins to charge <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> with ſaying that the true light ſhineth but in ſome, &amp; not in all, &amp; backs it with a lie, in ſaying that he could not prove it: but he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151290:14"/>to ſpeak the whole; for when <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> and I did reaſon with him about the true light, we did not uſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer haſtily, nor unadviſedly, but did enquire to this effect: There is the light of the Sun, which is a true light in its Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; alſo the Law of nature is a true light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. For whatſoever maketh manifeſt is light, and that Law or light which is in mans nature, doth make manifeſt ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a true light; but it is not that light which was ſpoken of in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. which is Chriſt; that he denieth to be in every man: He and I often denied ſomewhat to this effect, that that true light ſhineth or liveth not in every man, as it doth appear by our anſwer to their queries. For further proof of this, that this was our negative, or denial; I direct you to their ſecond query, and our anſwer to it, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and anſwered about thirteen moneths before the appearance of <hi>Iohn Moones</hi> printed Paper, entituled, <hi>The true light hath made manifeſt darkneſſe.</hi> He further ſaith, that <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> was demanded to prove that this true light did not ſhine in every man, but could not; whereas <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Scripture, to make good his denial, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. To the Law and to the Teſtimony: And if they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them: from this Scripture, <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> and others reaſoned to this effect: if all men do ſpeak according to the word and Teſtimony of God, then the true light ſhineth or liveth in all men: but all men ſpeaketh not according to the word and Teſtimony of God; therefore ſome men have not the true light ſhining, or living in them.</p>
                        <p>He ſaith further in his ſecond Page, Now ſee (ſaid he) how contrary to the Scripture he ſpeaketh, that would deny the Teſtimony of <hi>Iohn:</hi> but I ſay, that that man that would make <hi>Iohn</hi> a falſe witneſſe, may well be ranked with <hi>Iohn Moone;</hi> but <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> did own it, and dayly did bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with <hi>Iohn</hi> of the ſame truth; and becauſe that there is ſomething ſpoken of this, in the anſwer to his queries, I ſhall not ſpeak any more of it here; neither do I intend to anſwer to all his confuſed Paper, no, that is not my intention: but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151290:14"/>to make a ſhort reply to that, wherein he doth particularly and falſly accuſe, not onely me, but <hi>Hugh Ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In his 3. Pag. he ſaith, That <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſaid that Chriſt &amp; his Spirit is diſtinct: but he diminiſhed from his words, for <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſaid, that Chriſt &amp; his Spirit is diſtinct in their offices &amp; operations. Now I would deſire every honeſt mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the baſeneſſe of this man, that would cunningly and purpoſely leave out half the mans words, and put the other half out in Print; for theſe were the words that <hi>Hugh E. vans</hi> ſaid, That Chriſt and his Spirit are diſtinct in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and operations: Then <hi>John Moone</hi> accuſed him of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, in ſaying that Chriſt and his Spirit is diſtinct: Then <hi>Hugh</hi> ſaid, Why doſt thou divide my words? ſaid <hi>John Moone,</hi> I will publiſh thy blaſphemy: Then <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſaid, I charge thee to publiſh my whole ſaying. Now I would have every ſincere heart to judge, whether this man is not left here without a cover to hide his nakedneſſe and ſhame. Was it not a ſhameful thing for him to accuſe the man of blaſphemy, and yet he himſelf afraid to publiſh the whole pretended blaſphemy? or doth it not argue that his malitious mind would caſt a falſe aſperſion upon <hi>Hugh Evans,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which he profeſſed, which I believe he aimed amoſt at?</p>
                        <p>Again, conſider whether this man hath not made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of a good conſcience (if ever he had any) that would knowingly and purpoſedly miſrepreſent a man to all people, under the title of a Blaſphemer; &amp; yet would not publiſh his whole ſaying, which he did over &amp; over repeat. I do not ſpeak this becauſe that the ſaying is ſo groſſe in the terms, as <hi>John Moone</hi> hath put it out; but to ſhew the diſhoneſty of this perfect man: This I ſay to thee <hi>John Moone,</hi> that either thou doſt not underſtand the ſenſe of the word diſtinct, or elſe thou art very willing to make uprears and quarrels, where there is no cauſe: but I do believe both of thee, therefore I ſhal ſhew thee, how Chriſt &amp; his Spirit is not diſtinct: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, How he is diſtinct or diſtinguiſhed. The word diſtinct doth not alwayes mean two material things ſtanding at a diſtance the one from the other, as it is like thou doſt ignorantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151290:15"/>there is diſtance in places, in times, and in perſons, but neither of theſe diſtinctions is to be made between Chriſt &amp; his Spirit: there is alſo diſtinctions in natures, qualities, and properties; yet I do not ſay, that Chriſt and his Spirit is ſo to be diſtinguiſhed: The Father, Son, and Spirit is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, yet not divided (though it is like that thou doſt think, that whatſoever is diſtinguiſhed, is divided. There are three that bear witneſſe in Heaven, the Father, Son and the Spirit, and theſe three are one, yet diſtinguiſhed three; and ſo it may be ſaid of Chriſt and his Spirit: Very much may be ſaid of Chriſt being diſtinct in his Office, yet not ſeparated nor divided from his Spirit: Chriſt ſaid (as he was the Son of man) I have finiſhed the work which thou haſt given me to do: but it cannot be ſaid that the Spirit of Chriſt hath finiſhed his work until all be converted, that ever ſhall be converted, and all the Saints glorified; but the work of Chriſt in ſuffering for ſin in the fleſh, is finiſhed, yet Chriſt and his Spirit is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but diſtinguiſhed. It is like that <hi>John Moon</hi> thought, by leaving out part of the words which <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> had ſaid, that it would appear more like to be blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: It appeares alſo that <hi>John Moone</hi> did know that it was no blaſphemy, as <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> had ſpoken it; or at leaſt that he would not be believed by others, if he did write the whole ſaying: Take the wiſeſt mans ſpeech that ever was, and let me leave out what part I will of it; I know that I ſhall either make it blaſphemy, or non-ſenſe: as for inſtance, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14.1. which ſaith, The Fool ſaith in his heart, There is no God: leave out, The Fool ſaith in his heart, and then you may ſay, that the Scripture ſaith, There is no God. <hi>John Moones</hi> affirmative is true, but his negative is falſe; it is true that Chriſt and his Spirit is one; but to ſay, there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in their Offices, operations, and workings, is falſe, as may be further proved by many inſtances, but that the thing is ſo plain, that I deſire not to trouble the Reader any further: But know this, that Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is one, in reference to time, place, and perſon, and an
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151290:15"/>harmony of an agreement between them in their Offices, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and workings all in, and fulfilling of the will of the one onely wiſe God; I ſay further, that the onely wiſe pure Father, Son, Spirit, and Saints are one, and yet a thouſand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, I believe, may be obſerved, touching the Father, Son, Spirit, and Saints: and without diſtinctions, he (nor no man elſe) can ſpeak much of them, &amp; not blaſpheme. I ſay, ſaith <hi>John Moone,</hi> that they are one, and not diſtinct: Then I ſay, if there be no diſtinctions, why doth he call Chriſt and his Spirit <hi>they,</hi> which doth ſignifie pluralities? he nor no man elſe can ſpeak of the Father, Son, and Spirit, and not make diſtinctions: for in the words themſelves lieth diſtinctions: ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 22. where he ſpeaketh of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit, and theſe three are one; theſe, and thine, and mine, them, and us; all theſe words doth ſignifie diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet not diviſions; he goeth on to prove that Chriſt and his Spirit are one, and ſo fights with his own ſhadow; for nothing elſe hath he to fight with, for all will ſay, that Chriſt and his Spirit is one; but if any would deny it, he goeth very weakly to prove it, for he goeth about to prove that which all <hi>England</hi> doth acknowledge in words, and not make good any thing againſt what is affirmed, that Chriſt and his Spirit is diſtinguiſhed. And this is the effect of his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: becauſe <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> doth witneſſe union between Chriſt and his Spirit, therefore no diſtinction, as he ſaith: after he cited <hi>Rom</hi> 8.20. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. Now ſee where is the diſtinction (ſaith he) then he writes down, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22. Then ſaid he, Them that have an eye to ſee withal, let them ſee the confuſion which the Baptiſts declare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is his own confuſion, foaming out his own ſhame, and falſly accuſing thoſe whom he calls the Baptiſts, in ſaying that they ſay, That Chriſt and his Spirit is diſtinct the one from the other: but thou haſt grafted on this lie, ſince thou thy ſelf didſt repeat that part of the words which <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> had ſaid; for neither did <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſay, nor thy ſelf till now, that they were one from the other. Is this thy hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, firſt to diminiſh from the mans words, and inſtead of them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151290:16"/>adde thine own? <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſaid, That Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is diſtinct in offices, operations, and workings; and in ſtead of the words, operations, offices, and workings, thou addeſt <hi>one from the other;</hi> ſee how thou haſt handled, altered, and perverted the man's words: ſo with a parcel of the old Leſſon, in which we are judged and condemned, he goeth on, ſpeaking of the true Worſhippers, and of the falſe, applying the true to themſelves, and the falſe to the Baptiſts: ſo leaving, He begins with another lie.</p>
                        <p>In the latter end of his fourth Page he accuſeth me of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That there is another way beſides light and darkneſs: the which words never proceeded out of my mouth, as many can witneſſe who were there preſent: But this is the root of the matter; <hi>John Moone</hi> and his Brethren did uſe to hold forth that there is but two things, <hi>viz.</hi> light and darkneſs; God and the Devil; the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent: Then I did inquire what that is that is called to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe; for the ſeed of the Woman cannot Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be damned, and the ſeed of the Serpent cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Therefore there is ſomething elſe that is in danger of being damned, which by grace may be Eternally ſaved: But at that time which he ſaith that I did contradict him in his Teaching, it is not ſo; but I accuſed him of being a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet upon that which had paſſed between us at other times, more then any thing that he had ſpoken then; for when I came into the meeting-place, one of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe name is <hi>Hugh Lloyd,</hi> and others, whom he calls the Baptiſts, were diſputing; ſo that I began to ſpeak to <hi>Hugh Lloyd:</hi> Whereupon <hi>John Moone</hi> replied, and ſaid unto me, That I was a Blaſphemer, and the like termes, which his mouth is full of: ſo that the diſcourſe began about the threeneſſe. When he did put me to prove him to be a falſe Prophet, the firſt thing that I did inſtance then was this; Thou ſayeſt that there is but two things, that is, God and the Devil: Then he puts me to prove the third: I ſaid, That it was man: then he ſaid ſomething to this effect; That man was one with God, and became one with the Devil; I replied, that they were
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151290:16"/>three diſtinct things in nature or eſſence: but that I ſhould ſay, That they are one from the other, is as true, as that <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> ſhould ſay, That Chriſt and his Spirit were one from the other. I would have the Reader know, that we could not then have any orderly reaſoning with theſe men, therefore there cannot be as good account given of it, as it might, if they would obſerve order; and yet they will cry out againſt confuſion as much as any people.</p>
                        <p>And as he diminiſhed from <hi>Hugh Evans</hi> his words, ſo he addeth to my words: for I ſaid not One from another; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ſay three wayes, but things: So he preſſed upon me to prove by Scriptures, them to be three diſtinct things. Then I produced the Scriptures, which ſaith, In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created the Heavens and the Earth: Then, In the beginning was God, before there was man; therein they were diſtinct, or diſtinguiſhed the one before the other; the one being Eternal before all times; the other having a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in time. Thirdly, I produced the third Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> in the beginning of the Chapter, which ſheweth the Devils coming to tempt man: Then I asked, Which of the three will you deny? Then one of their Teachers, named <hi>Hugh Lloyd,</hi> ſaid; We deny man. I would have the Reader to underſtand, that there was ſo much diſorder and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was in vain for me to proceed orderly, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh their natures, properties, and qualities; for they were more like Oyſter-women ſcoulding, then moderate men reaſoning or diſcourſing; for many were ſpeaking at once, as their manner is: and ſeldome had I any better termes then Serpent, or Dog, thou wouldeſt bite if thou couldeſt; the Judgement and wrath of God is thy Portion, with many more words of the like nature as theſe are: I do not ſay, That I do repeat all that hath paſſed between us that day, neither can I; but this I can ſay, that I do not leave any thing unrepeated, which doth deſtroy the ſenſe of that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, (that I know of.)</p>
                        <p>The pure holy wiſe Creator created all things, and formed man in his own image: but it is no leſs then blaſphemy to ſay,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151290:17"/>That God is formed or made, therefore they are diſtinct, or we muſt diſtinguiſh between the Creator and the Creature. Again, if there was no diſtinction to be made between God and man, What need was there of Laws and Precepts to bind man upon penalty of death (if broken?) and though the Text ſaith, God created man in his own image, it doth not follow, that therefore no diſtinction is to be obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Creator and the Creature: and further, they are diſtinguiſhed by their names, for if there were no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherefore have they two names; Alſo they differ in nature: The nature of God was not, nor is not ſubject to change nor alter: But the nature of man was, and is ſubject to alter. Thus they were diſtinguiſhed to be before man fell. Now after the fall of man, and after he had hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Devil, and became partaker of his nature; yet he became not preſently a Devil, for as man bore the image of God before the fall, yet man was not very God before the fall; neither is he very Devil after the fall: Therefore it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth of many diſtinctions between God and man before the fall, and alſo many diſtinctions between man and the Devil after the fall: for if there be no diſtinctions between God and man before the fall; then there was nothing to fall, unleſſe ſome part of God ſhould fall; which is no leſſe then blaſphemy to ſay that God nor any part of him ſhould fall: For he is the holy, wiſe, individual and unchangeable God. Again, if man after the fall was become a very Devil, then there is nothing to be reſtored to the image of God, but that which is or was a very Devil; but there is ſomething which ſhall be reſtored, which is not, nor was not wholly a Devil; for it is written, He took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> I had many times told this unconſcionable lying man theſe, or the like words, That there was but two wayes, or light and darkneſſe: And man was the third thing, which doth walk in one of the two wayes: But this I alwayes did, and do deny ſtill, that there is no union between men and the Devil; but that which is by participating of his nature, and not that they are eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one.</p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:151290:17"/>
                        <p>And now in his fifth Page, where he comes to give his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning it; I find no difference between that which I ſaid, and that which he now ſaith in his Paper, but onely this: I ſaid, that man walked in one of theſe two ways; and he ſaith, And man is in the one way. I leave the Reader to judge, whether he ſpeaks ſenſe, or non-ſenſe, conſidering his following words. So he concludes that particular with theſe words, Let the wiſe in heart judge where the third way is; as though his Oppoſer had ſaid, that there were three wayes. And in the latter part of his fifth Page he ſaith, That I ſhould ſay, that Faith is not the gift of God; a thing that I cannot remember that I had any diſcourſe with him about: But whether I have ſaid ſo or no; I tell you what I ſhould ſay, if I ſhould ſpeak my judgement concerning it: I ſay, That believing, or giving credit to the word of God, is an Act of the Creature, performed by the Power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity given him of God, as it is written, With the heart man believeth to Righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſſion is made to Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 20.20. I marvel how the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> and others are ſo beſotted, that they do not ſee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving or Faith in that ſenſe is a duty required of man: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neglect of it, he is threatned; and upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, he is commended, according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. He that believeth ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned. <hi>John Moone</hi> ſaith, That the Faith whereby a man is ſaved from his ſins, is the gift of God: And I ſay, If man be not ſaved from the puniſhment due for ſin, that the cauſe is not in God, for not giving; but in man for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. He ſaith, That I ſpake contrary to the Scriptures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. By grace ye are ſaved (through Faith) not of your ſelves; it is the gift of God.</p>
                        <p>I deny not that Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. but own it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo own Salvation to be the gift of God, which the Apoſtle in that place doth affirme to be the gift of God, and excludes all manner of works from having any part or ſhare in the work of Salvation. So having no deſire to be tedious to the Reader, and conſidering that other mens Pens have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151290:18"/>upon this ſubject, which I eſteeme far before my own.</p>
                        <p>In Page the ſeventh, <hi>John Moone</hi> faith, That one <hi>Rees Davies,</hi> and another, ſhould ſay, That in the Devil there is as much of God as makes him tremble: But <hi>Rees Davies</hi> ſaith, That he ſaid not ſo; but theſe are the words which <hi>Rees Davies</hi> ſaid, That there is ſo much fear in the Devil, as makes him tremble; as for the other, I own not his words, nor himſelf neither.</p>
                        <p>In Page the eighth, <hi>John Moone</hi> quarrelleth with another, whoſe name is <hi>John Proſſer,</hi> and accuſeth him of ſaying, That <hi>Ribbon</hi> and <hi>Lace</hi> doth adorn the Goſpel; but the man ſaith with many witneſſes, That it is a notorious lie, which <hi>John Moone</hi> ſaith of him; and I believe that there is but few, if there be any, that will believe that any reaſonable man will ſay, that <hi>Ribbon</hi> and <hi>Lace</hi> doth adorn the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>In Page the ninth, <hi>John Moone</hi> ſaith, That one <hi>Evan Oliver</hi> ſhould ſay, That God and his grace is not both one: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſaid ſo, or no, I do not know; for he is and hath been in <hi>Scotland</hi> ever ſince; but I believe that he might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between God and his grace, and yet hold <hi>Union</hi> alſo.</p>
                        <p>And as for our Friend <hi>Vavaſor Powel,</hi> I have been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that he doth intend to anſwer for himſelf; and judging him to be abler and ſitter then I my ſelf am, I ſhall not ſay any thing of it, neither can I well, by reaſon that I heard not the diſcourſe, nor have not any account of it, But what <hi>John Moone</hi> ſaith of it in his Papers, which are not to be given cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto.</p>
                        <p>And as for <hi>John Moone</hi> his Queries in the cloſe of his Book, I leave them to be anſwered by thoſe to whom they were propounded; for the life of ſanctified and Baptized Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is hid in God. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3.

                        <p>I Hearing that the people which by ſome are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> were to meet there, and that one <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> was to Preach there that day; I knowing my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I might try all thing, &amp; hold faſt that which is good,</p>
                        <p>I went there, and hearing the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> ſpeaking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often unto the people of a pure principle of God in every man, which pure principle is in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in bondage and in ſlavery in man, and muſt be redeemed.</p>
                        <p>And when he had done ſpeaking, I was moved to ſpeak theſe words following.</p>
                        <p>Friend, Thou haſt ſpoken much unto the people, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a pure principle of God in every man, which pure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is in ſlavery, and in bondage, and muſt be redeemed.</p>
                        <p>I would know of thee, whether thou doeſt own any part in man, which is to be redeemed, beſides this pure principle of God.</p>
                        <p>Then the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> drew near unto me, and asked me ſome other queſtion; but did not anſwer to the queſtion which I had propounded.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon I told him, that I would not anſwer him in any thing, until he had anſwered to the queſtion which I had propounded.</p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:151290:21"/>
                        <p>And then the people many of them did rage and rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me with open mouth, carping at they know not what, like Dogs barking at the Moon.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> fathered that uproar upon me; whereas there had not proceeded out of my mouth (at that time) any words but theſe above written; and then I ſtated the queſtion again as followeth.</p>
                        <p>Queſtion: <hi>Whether thou dost own a humane ſoul in man, which is to be redeemed, beſides that pure principle of God?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He Anſwered:</hi> The Soul is pure.</p>
                        <p>I replied, that Jeſus Chriſt came not to redeeme a pure principle of God, but an impure ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Then ſaid he, Can the ſoul be defiled? Can the ſoul be deſiled?</p>
                        <p>I ſaid, The Soul can be defiled; and the Soul is defiled through the fall in the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He ſaid, The ſoul is under ſin and ſlavery, but it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with ſin.</p>
                        <p>Then there was one that ſtood there for their ſide, ſtirred up with a very wrathful diſtempered Spirit, and ſaid unto the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> Brother, I charge thee before God and theſe men, that thou ſhalt not ſpeak with this man: And when he had thus ſpoken three times, then the ſaid <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſaid, That he would not ſpeak with me: and ſo withdrew from me.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon I ſpake unto the people, what he had ſaid concerning mens ſouls, that they could not be defiled with ſin; to the end that all thoſe that ſee, and are not ſtark blind, might have a ſight of his erronious Judgement.</p>
                        <p>Then the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> drew near me again, leſt his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſhould be uncloaked, and his Doctrine laid naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people, ſaying, Do not wreſt my words: I ſay, The ſoul is pure.</p>
                        <p>I denied that the ſoul is pure, to which end Chriſt came in the Fleſh, for to purifie impure ſouls: I did bid him prove his affirmative.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon one <hi>John Moone,</hi> it ſeems of the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151290:21"/>and <hi>Alexander,</hi> did bid me prove, that the ſoul is not pure.</p>
                        <p>I ſaid, I was not to prove a negative, and ſo I did demand of them to prove that the ſoul is pure.</p>
                        <p>Then the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> urged that Scripture in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>God breathed into</hi> [man] <hi>the breath of life, and man became a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſaid, that doth not prove what the Soul is, but what the ſoul was.</p>
                        <p>Here it appeareth, that leſt he ſhould receive a total rout, or a deadly wound with his own ſtaffe, and his falſe Tenet be ſtript bare; he ſaid, that he ſpake of his own Soul.</p>
                        <p>Now a word unto the ſaid <hi>Alexander Parker,</hi> and <hi>John Moone,</hi> who ſay, You ſpeak from the mouth of the Lord, and by that infallible Spirit, as the holy men of God did, and are fully perfect. How is it that the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> hath ſaid, and the ſaid <hi>John Moone</hi> ſeeming to maintain what he had ſaid? and if he ſpake of his own Soul, to be under ſin and ſlavery, how is it that he is alſo perfect?</p>
                        <p>Or is it not rather clear, according to his general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that day, and the queſtion propounded, that he ſpake of every mans Soul? but leſt he ſhould be trapped in his own ſnare, he ſaid, He ſpake of his own Soul.</p>
                        <p>Here I charge thee with a lie (either of you) ſhew me if you can, which way you can eſcape it, let me ſee which way you can dawb up this tottering Wall with your untempered Morter, or elſe be aſhamed of your ignorance, and confeſſe your Error, and repent.</p>
                        <p>Now to all you that are impartial, and unbiaſſed, that can weigh the truth in the Balance of Juſtice do I appeal,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether that Propoſition I propounded, was a thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or material that day?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether the propounding of that queſtion onely was a cauſe of an uproar?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whether it was a difficult thing for me to prove from Scripture that the Soul was defiled with ſin?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Whether that Scripture,</hi> Gen. 2.7. <hi>doth prove his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151290:22"/>Soul, or any other man's Soul, to be pure ſince our fall in the first</hi> Adam?</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Whether this lying and equivocating aforeſaid, be from the mouth of the Lord, and by the infallible Spirit? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it by the Spirit of Error, and from the mouth of Antichrist, who is the Lord of lyes?</hi>
                        </p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151290:22"/>both in them that believe, and in them that periſh: and what was ſpoken there of the myſtery of Godlineſſe, which is hid from all vulterous eyes, and venemous Beaſts, ſhall ſtand for ever: and concerning redemption, and the groanes and cryes of the Innocent that groaneth for deliverance, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> groaned under <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> this ſhalt thou <hi>Bownd,</hi> and all people one day confeſſe to be truth; and I appeal to all of that in thy conſcience, and all peoples conſciences, when any evil of ſin is committed, upon the ſenſe and feeling of it, many times ſighes and groanes will be heard, and the groans and cryes are entered into the eares of the Lord of Sabbath; and he is now riſen in his Majeſty and dreadful Power, for the redemption of his own people, and will burn up the chaffe, the wicked and carnal Profeſſors, and give them their Portion in the lake of endleſſe miſery; and this ſhalt thou witneſſe, when the Book of conſcience is opened, and the liar hath his Portion: And whereas thou <hi>Bownd</hi> ſaith, That after <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> had done ſpeaking, thou ſpake unto him. Whether he did own any part in man, which is to be redeemed, beſides that pure principle which he had been ſpeaking of; and thou ſayeſt, he did not anſwer to the queſtion which thou propoundedſt: which thing is falſe; for anſwer was made in plainneſſe, to the ſatisfaction of many; though thou could not receive it, being full and rich in thy own conceit, and ſo was ſent empty away: and after the truth was cleared, to the ſatisfaction of many people, the Meſſenger of the Lord paſſed away, and then hearing thee <hi>Bownd</hi> incenſing the people with lies, he came up again, and then was ſomething ſpoken concerning the Soul; but not before he paſſed down, as thou in thy Paper falſely aſſerts; and the Soul was ſaid to be pure, which thou <hi>Bownd,</hi> who knows not the Soul, denied: But the truth ſhall ſtand for ever, and over the deceipt Reign; and that in the conſcience ſhall anſwer it, and witneſſe to it: And thou <hi>Bownd</hi> ſaith in thy lying Paper, That before he, to wit, <hi>Alexander Parker,</hi> went down, thou ſtated thy queſtion: Doſt thou own a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul, which is to be redeemed, beſides, &amp;c. This is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151290:23"/>falſe, and a lie; thou didſt not mention any ſuch queſtion, before he ſpake of the Souls redemption, and ſo thou liar art for the lake. Several other things there is in thy Paper, which truely are not worth the rapping up, nor mentioning by a ſober Chriſtian, which ſtuffe I do return back into the old Bottle again, from whence it came; and the ſame Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that I gave of the Soul, I give the ſame ſtill, that the Soul is pretious and pure witneſſed, though not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the dark wiſedom of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THe greateſt cauſe of my Relating of this Diſcourſe, and bringing theſe few Lines into ſuch a publicke view, is, becauſe <hi>John Moone</hi> in his lying Book, entituled, <hi>The true Light hath made manifest darkneſſe,</hi> hath caſt falſe aſperſions, and lying accuſations upon the Saints in <hi>Wales,</hi> beginning with <hi>Hugh Evans,</hi> who is now ceaſed from his labours: I being one that was very well acquainted with his Doctrine, life, and converſation; and the certainty I have of thoſe ſweet, Divine, Spiritual, and Eternal enjoyments that his Soul hath had, and hath, and ſhall enjoy to Eternity, out of the mortal body, doth remove much grief and ſadneſſe from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151290:24"/>my Spirit, in conſideration of his abſence in the body: I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo having a diſcovery of the lying and equivocating of <hi>John Moone,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Parker,</hi> and others that tread in their erronious ſteps; therefore I am engaged to manifeſt ſome of it, to the end that the tongues of publicke known liars may not eaſily paſſe their falſe aſperſions, and that truth and Juſtice may take place, and that falſhood, and all falſe dealers may be found, and taken in their own ſnares, and wounded with their own Weapons. Although I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelf the weakeſt amongſt many, yet ſeeing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed rejoyce, and <hi>Goliah</hi> ſtanding vapouring in the field, <hi>viz. John Moone</hi> with his lying Book, deſying <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I am emboldened to preſſe into the Battail: for who is this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed Philiſtine, that he ſhould defie the Armies of the living God?</p>
                        <p>I being both an eye and an ear-witneſſe unto that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between <hi>John Price</hi> and <hi>John Moone,</hi> where <hi>John Moone</hi> falſly in his Book accuſeth <hi>John Price,</hi> in ſaying, that he ſaid, There was three wayes: This is falſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is one cauſe, Why I publiſh <hi>John Moone</hi> for a known lyer; for the Diſcourſe was grounded upon three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct things, <hi>viz.</hi> God, Man, and Devil: Whereupon <hi>John Moone</hi> Denied one of theſe three; <hi>John Moone</hi> did bid him prove them diſtinct, the which he did prove, God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor creating, and man created, and the Devil deceiving; which three were punctually proved: But becauſe the Letter of the Scripture did not name them in this term diſtinct, it ſhould not paſſe with him.</p>
                        <p>Then <hi>John Price</hi> asked him, Which of theſe three would he deny? Then one of <hi>John Moones</hi> fellow-Teachers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I may ſay, his Fellow deceiver, named <hi>Hugh Lloyd,</hi> ſaid, that they denied man: Whereupon <hi>John Moone</hi> being the more ſubtil, drew the ſame <hi>Hugh Lloyd</hi> back by the ſhoulder, and ſaid, Let me alone with them. Then we ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151290:25"/>to this purpoſe: If it were ſo, to whom was the Goſpel Preached, and to what end Chriſt came in the fleſh? But <hi>John Moone,</hi> as his manner was uſually before, ſaid, There was but light and darkneſſe, God and Devil; although he would not deal ſo plain as the other did, as to deny man; yet he would not deny what the other had ſaid: whereupon we brought this conſequence upon his own words; and we told him what abſurdities would follow: That is, That if God and man were not diſtinct, if man did fall, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture declareth, then the onely pure wiſe infallible God muſt alſo fall, which is blaſphemy in a high meaſure: And alſo we told him, That if man and Devil were not diſtinct, that then it muſt unavoidably follow, that that Chriſt which came from the boſome of the Father to redeem Sinners, came alſo to redeem Devils: The which is moſt erronious. With this, his mouth was ſtopped for the preſent, as unto theſe things, and had nothing to ſay; and then the neareſt way they had to eſcape, the ſaid <hi>Hugh Lloyd</hi> ſtept up upon a feat, or ſome other high place, and there began to ſpeak to the people, and to thunder our ſuch railings, and curſings, and Plagues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, that we could not have any further opportunity to ſpeak: and then, when I got a little time to ſpeak, I ſpake ſomething to the people, concerning thoſe mens erronious Doctrines: then <hi>John Moone</hi> having recruited himſelf afreſh, amongſt other railings ſpake theſe words: Thou <hi>Bownd,</hi> thou Serpent, thou Son of the Devil, thy brains ſhall be daſhed againſt the ſtones; and ſo I was ſilenced by their confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Babel</hi>-uproar.</p>
                        <p>Then I having by the goodneſſe of God ſome inſight into their Tenets; I went nearer unto the ſaid <hi>John Moone,</hi> and asked him what part in me was that which he thundered all thoſe Plagues againſt; or whether that part through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedient to that light which he ſaid was in me, might eſcape them: he anſwered, The Candle of the wicked ſhall be put out: I told him that he ſpake non-ſenſe, as in anſwer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151290:25"/>to that which I propounded: then he endeavoured to inform the people that I ſaid, That the Scripture was non-ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>I was accuſed alſo in another Paper jointly with <hi>John Price,</hi> for ſaying, That the Devil was Eternal, as to Eternity, or without end, by <hi>John Moone,</hi> and one <hi>Edward Stephens,</hi> who in that Paper ſaid, That they both bare witneſſe that there was nothing Eternal but God, and that which is one with God.</p>
                        <p>Now ſeeing that the aforeſaid <hi>John Price</hi> hath already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto the ſame accuſation, for brevity ſake, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Reader unto his reply fore-mentioned in this Book; but onely I ſhall lay down ſome abſurdities, that muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follow.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, concerning Angels, they all having their ariſe in the ſame Original Root, are either Eternal, or external.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, if they be external, then it followeth that all the Angelical quire of Heaven, and alſo thoſe that fell from their firſt eſtates, ſhall be annihilated, and come to nothing; which is to ſay, Heaven, or God's Throne will be found void of Angels; and alſo Hell will be void of Devils.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If the fallen Angels are Eternal, according to <hi>John Moones</hi> ſaying, That there is nothing Eternal but God, or that which is one with God: Then it followeth that the holy and unchangeable God did alſo fall: the which ſayings are fearful to expreſſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Concerning <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul, or all mens Souls in <hi>Adam,</hi> in his fallen condition, before the Sprouts of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tree, or the variety of Nations ſprang forth, they were alſo all either Eternal or external: if external, then it followeth, that the Souls of all the Saints muſt ceaſe from their ſenſe and feeling of all their ſweet enjoyments; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151290:26"/>likewiſe the Souls of the damned from all their woe and torments.</p>
                        <p>And if they are Eternal, then it followeth according to <hi>Iohn Moones</hi> ſayings, as aforeſaid,</p>
                        <p>That the Souls of all men in general are either God, or one with God, and cannot be defiled with ſin, nor damned for ſin.</p>
                        <p>Doth it not here plainly appear, that all the Plagues and woes which they pronounce againſt men, are but againſt the external, or outward part of man, and the Aſtral Souls or life, the which is but for a time, and ſhall be done away?</p>
                        <p>Is not here the ground of all their ſayings found out? <hi>Iohn Moone</hi> affirming that there is but two things, which is to ſay, Light and darkneſſe, Heaven and Hell, God and Devil.</p>
                        <p>And is not here their beginning (as they call it) and the ariſe of <hi>Alexander Parker's</hi> own ſaying, That the Soul was under ſin and ſlavery, but could not be defiled with ſin? And is not this that pure principle of God, which they ſay is in every man in bondage and ſlavery, and muſt be redeemed?</p>
                        <p>How now <hi>Moone</hi> and <hi>Parker?</hi> have I not prickt you here in your right wound? yea, are ye not here found out? Is not all your lying, and equivocating, and falſe accuſing of others, proved too ſhort a covering for you to hide you in?</p>
                        <p>But it may be that you will ſay, That I have wronged you, and brought a ſcandal upon you.</p>
                        <p>To the which I reply, that if you are here wronged, it is by your own words; for I have here but onely made uſe of your own expreſſions from your own mouths, and followed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151290:26"/>your own foot-ſteps unto this denne, whence you ſprang forth.</p>
                        <p>Let this be told you out of the Bowels of love unto your poor Souls, that if you had come to the right and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, you ſhould have ſeen the ariſe and Original Root of Angels, and humane Souls, how they were generated, and came forth out of an Eternal Root in love and anger; and how the Angels that fell from their firſt eſtates, advanced, or domineered over, or above the meek love, and are held captive, and are reſerved in everlaſting Chains under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unto the Judgement of the great day.</p>
                        <p>And how <hi>Adam</hi>'s right, true humane Soul, or all men's Souls in <hi>Adam,</hi> fell from their happy eſtate, and became dead, as to the light and love, and were defiled with ſin, and captivated in the anger, and yet no part of that undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God corrupted.</p>
                        <p>Now unto you poor beſotted Souls that are taken by the fair out-ſide ſhews of theſe forementioned Errors, and yet have not altogether ſwallowed up the very dregs of their poiſoned Cups; notwithſtanding you have ſoon learned that ſame Leſſon of oppoſing, railing, curſing, and condemning of all thoſe that tread not in your foot-ſteps, becauſe they are not taken with thoſe fancies that you have fixed in your own braines; although thouſands of them are more Heavenly and Spiritual then you your ſelves. Alſo you uſe your utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours, to make the Saints names odious in the ſight of others: By theſe and other meanes you have cauſed the blind to go out of the way, and the ſeeking Souls to look back; have you not alſo quit and ſold all your reading, your meditating, and your earneſt ſeeking of God, for railing and frivolous contending about you know not what, yea about a falſe Doctrine, that was never found in the Rowles of God's Divine Court, and never owned nor confirmed by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151290:27"/>his dear and onely Son, nor publiſhed by his Holy Spirit; which is to ſay. That all mens Souls are either God, or one with God, and cannot be defiled with ſin, nor condemned for ſin; and that all the Plagues and woes that are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, are but againſt the external, or outward part of man, the which ſhall be done away.</p>
                        <p>Here I have briefly out of love, and not in oppoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, but onely unto the man of ſin, given you a diſcovery of the ſnare, that is ſecretly layed before your Souls; but if you will ſhut your eyes, and ſtop your eares, and ſo wilfully remain blind, your blood ſhall be upon your own heads, and I ſhall here waſh my hands from the guilt of your erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous revolt.</p>
                        <p>Now unto you the Cainiſh Cathedral Stone-church Prieſts, and Tithe-mongers, and new upſtart Hirelings, you are all for what you can hear ſaid againſt any that in any meaſure do oppoſe you in your function: Although I have put my hand to the publiſh of the diſcovery of ſome men's Errors; think not that I ſhal put my leaſt finger to the maintaining of yours: you are all for the back and belly, and for your own glory, if you had but wherewith to attain it: ſome of you have been for theſe many years daunted with the fear of your own ruine; yet you uſually rejoyce to hear, that any are cryed down beſides your ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Let the ſight and feeling of your own covetous carnal corrupt mindes, ſtop your mouths.</p>
                        <p>Let your proud and haughty hearts become meek and lowly.</p>
                        <p>Let your confounded Languages become ſilent.</p>
                        <p>And let your <hi>Babel</hi>-building ceaſe.</p>

                        <p>Let thoſe that ſtole, ſteal no more: Let ſhame cover your faces; and let your glory fall to the duſt.</p>
                        <p>Let God ariſe, and let all fleſh be ſilent before the Lord.</p>
                        <p>Your dumb Miniſtry is fruitleſſe, and your words are empty, vain, and pithleſſe, and ſhall not profit the people, ſaith the Lord.</p>

                        <p>Now unto you blind-folded worldlings, and prodigal proud ſtone-Kirke Members, the Devil hath found you a Toy to play withall in theſe dayes; thoſe ſeldom times that you come under the means of grace, &amp; true Preaching of the word, whereby you, in being attentive &amp; diligent to hear, might have a right and true ſalve applied unto your wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrupted Souls: But inſtead of ſo doing, your wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſcoffing minds are then (by your Driver) fitted for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign: you ſlight all that is ſaid concerning your own dangerous ſinful ſlaviſh condition, and you alſo are all for

                        <p>Your oppoſing of the one Party, is more out of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of your Spirits againſt the truths they ſometimes ſpeak of, then out of any ſenſible knowledge that you have of the Errors they maintain.</p>
                        <p>And the other Party that you ſometimes vainly prate for, it is out of your partiality, and outward reſpect you have to their perſons, or rather would be reſpected by them, more then out of any love you have to any truth that they hold forth: for you know not truth from falſhood; neither can you diſcern between Errors and found Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have forſaken the God that created you; and ye know not your Redeemer: your hearts are made fat, your eyes are ſhut, and your ears are ſtopped; you ſee, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you hear, but do not underſtand, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.20. You ſleight the meanes of grace, and you know not the day of your Viſitation.</p>
                        <p>Your terribleneſſe and the pride of your hearts hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you, O you that dwell in the clefts of the Rocks, and proudly walk upon the high Hills, and make your neſts as high as the <hi>Eagle,</hi> or amongſt the Stars: yet I will bring you down, ſaith the Lord. <hi>Jer.</hi> 49 20. <hi>Obad.</hi> 4. You forſake the Paths of uprightneſſe, to walk in the wayes of darkneſſe; you rejoyce to do evil, and delight in the frowardneſſe of the wicked. Woe be unto you that call good evil, and evil good, that put darkneſſe for light, and light for darkneſſe,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151290:28"/>that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter. Woe unto them that are wiſe in their own eyes, &amp; prudent in their own ſight: Woe unto them that are mighty to drink Wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drink, which juſtifie the wicked for reward, and take away the righteouſneſſe of the Righteous from him: therefore as the fire devoureth the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the flame conſumeth the chaffe, ſo their Root ſhall be rottenneſſe, and their Bloſſome ſhall go up as duſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have caſt away the Law of the Lord of Hoſts, and deſpiſed the word of the Holy one of <hi>Iſrael. Iſai.</hi> 5.20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
                        <p>O Poor wretched and miſerable men, let this be told you, that your temporal joy is the producing of your Eternal woe and ſorrow; and that the time draweth near, when your laughter ſhall be turned into weeping, and your joy into heavineſſe; and you ſhall be deprived of all your temporal enjoyments, and the object of your fooliſh mirth and youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rejoycing ſhall be done away, and then ſorrow and grief will approach unto you, and horror and anguiſh will ſeize upon you, and you will be found naked, and void of the Wedding-Garment, and be bound hand and foot, and caſt into utter darkneſſe, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</p>
                        <p>Now unto you carnal Profeſſors, and meer lip-labourers, that draw near unto God with your mouths, and honour him with your lips, but your hearts are far from him.</p>
                        <p>You have learned to talk of a God, and Godlineſſe, but the onely true God, and the Power of Godlineſſe you know not; your chiefeſt Treaſure is tranſitory, and the object of your joy is but for a moment; your Webs ſhall not become Garments, neither ſhall you cover your ſelves with your works; your works are the works of Iniquity, and the Act of violence is in your hands; the way of peace you know
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:151290:29"/>not, and there is no Judgement in your goings; you have made unto you: crooked Paths; whoſoever goeth therein, ſhall not know Peace: Woe be unto you that are at eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> yea you that have put your hands to the Plow, and are looking back; therefore you are not fit for the Kingdom of God <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9 62. You ſow the wind, and reap the whirl-wind; you conceive chaffe, and bring forth ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; your words are empty, your Wombs are barren, and your breſts are dry.</p>
                        <p>Your building is founded upon the Sands, you are a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Vineyard. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.2. Bearing ſowre Grapes; you are Clouds without Water, carried about with winds, dry Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Trees whoſe Fruit withereth, without Fruit, twice dead, pluckt up by the Roots. <hi>Jude</hi> 12.</p>
                        <p>O blind, naked, and miſerable men, let this be told you, that the work of regeneration and the new birth, is an earneſt work, and that it requireth very much careful watching, and continual ſtriving. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13 24. <hi>Marke</hi> 13.33, 35. And earneſt preſſing to be brought forth out of the corrupt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the pure nothing, which is all in all.</p>
                        <p>Now unto the deſpiſed ſeeking Souls, who earneſtly ſeek the Lord in truth, in ſailing over this Ocean of miſery; your Ship hath been grievouſly toffed by many a raging Wave, and by ſide-winds have been caſt near many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gulfs; yet during the time of theſe ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, by great providence, and unſpeakable mercies, you caſt forth your Anchors upon a ſure Rock; and when the calm cometh, ſo that you take a view of thoſe dangers that you have eſcaped, and rejoyce; yet you aſcribe not the glory of your deliverance unto your ſelves, but earneſtly make toward the promiſed Land, notwithſtanding you mourn over thoſe that are over-turned; yet your mourning ſhall be turned into joy; your building is founded upon the Rock; your
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:151290:29"/>Treaſure is not corrupt: You have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens: No Lion ſhall be there, nor any Ravenous Beaſts ſhall go up thereon; it ſhall not be found there, but the Redeemed ſhall walk there.</p>
                        <p>And the Ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to <hi>Zion</hi> with Songs, and everlaſting joy upon their heads, and they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſſe, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.</p>
